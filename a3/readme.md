Background color changing has been implemented as an optional feature of this assignment. \
You can click on the background area around the avatar's head where the cursor becomes a hand. The background color is by default transparent. You can change it using the color picker. The background will be transparent when exported to PNG if you have set its opacity. It also will preserve the opacity information of any SVG elements (e.g. Hair, clothes) that you have set.
